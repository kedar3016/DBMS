Write PL/SQL code to calculate the area of circle for a value of radius varying from 5 to 
9. Store the radius and corresponding values of calculated area in empty table named 
areas, consisting of two columns, radius and area


CREATE TABLE areas (
    radius NUMBER,
    area NUMBER
);

DECLARE
    v_radius NUMBER;
    v_area NUMBER;
BEGIN
    FOR v_radius IN 5..9 LOOP

        v_area := 3.14159 * POWER(v_radius, 2); -- Assuming pi as approximately 3.14159

        INSERT INTO areas (radius, area) VALUES (v_radius, v_area);
    END LOOP;

    COMMIT;
END;
