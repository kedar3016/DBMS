3.2 all types of joins

Design SQL queries for suitable database application using SQL DML statements: all types 
of Join.
Salesman(salesman_id, name, city, commission )
Customer(customer_id, cust_name,city,grade,salesman_id) 
1) write a SQL query to find the salesperson and customer who reside in the same city. 
Return Salesman, cust_name and city.
2) write a SQL query to find salespeople who received commissions of more than 12 
percent from the company. Return Customer Name, customer city, Salesman, 
commission.
3) write a SQL query to display the customer name, customer city, grade, salesman 
name, salesman city. The results should be sorted by ascending customer_id.
4) Write a SQL statement to generate a list in ascending order of salespersons who work 
either for one or more customers or have not yet joined any of the customers

2) SELECT customer.cust_name, customer.city, salesman.name, salesman.commission
FROM customer
INNER JOIN salesman

FROM customer
INNER JOIN salesman
ON customer.salesman_id = salesman.salesman_id
ORDER BY customer.customer_id;

4) SELECT salesman.name
FROM salesman
LEFT JOIN customer
ON salesman.salesman_id = customer.salesman_id
ORDER BY salesman.salesman_id;
