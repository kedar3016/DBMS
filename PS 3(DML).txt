Design SQL queries for suitable database application using SQL DML statements: SubQuery and View
Use suitable tables. Employee ( Emp id, First_name, Last_name, Salary, Designation, 
Dept_no). 
Department(Dept_No, Dept_Name, Location)
a) write a SQL query to find those employees who receive a higher salary than the 
employee with ID 163. Return first name, last name. 
b) write a SQL query to find out which employees have the same designation as the 
employee whose ID is 169. Return first name, last name, department ID
c) write a SQL query to find those employees who earn more than the average salary. 
Return employee ID, first name, last name.
d) Display a record who has minimum salary
e) Display a record who has maximum salary
f) Create view on Department and Employee table.
g) Create sequence.
h) Create index on emp_id




a) SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employee
WHERE salary > (SELECT salary FROM employee WHERE emp_id = 163);

b) SELECT first_name, last_name, dept_no
FROM employee
WHERE designation = (SELECT designation FROM employee WHERE emp_id = 169);

c) SELECT emp_id, first_name, last_name
FROM employee
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employee);

d) SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE salary = (SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employee);

e) SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee);

f) CREATE VIEW emp_dept
AS
SELECT *
FROM employee
JOIN department
ON employee.dept_no = department.dept_no;

g) CREATE SEQUENCE emp_seq
START WITH 1
INCREMENT BY 1;

h) CREATE INDEX emp_id_idx
ON employee (emp_id);
